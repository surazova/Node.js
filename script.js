//Lesson 3 of Node.js 
//All about the v8 engine
//A JS enginge takes Javascript and changes the code into machine code-something that the computer can understand. 
//Machine code order: Javascript, C++, Assembly language, Machine Code 
//Node.js is written in C++
//V8 is imbedded into node.js 
//When you pass the JS, it's changed into machine code
//Node.js with V8: JavaScript-->C++, Node.js, V8-->Machine Code
