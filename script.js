//Lesson 11 Node.js 
//Clients and Servers 
//A client sends a request to a server and the server sends a response to the client 

//You use protocols to communicate 
//Protocols are a set of rules that two sides agree with in oder to communicate 
//FTP (file transfer protocol)
//HTTP (Used for websites)
//When the structure is decided, the information is sent 
//Then TCP is used, which splits the data into small sections called packets 
//Node.js allows us to open the connection between computers 
//We tell node.js what information we want to respond to

//Ports 
//If node.js is litening to requests in a particular port, what comes there will be read by node
