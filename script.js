//Lesson 13 Node.js 
//Creating streams 
//Buffer: a temporary storage spot for data that is being transferred 
//the buffer is filled with data 
//Stream: data that flows in time into the buffer, that collects small chunks of data, then it gets sent to the clients 
//Streams in node.js can increase performance and transfer data
